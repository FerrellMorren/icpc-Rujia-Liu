The problem description is wrong!

I will put the right description here:

Let x1, x2,..., xm be real numbers satisfying the following conditions:
a)
-$ {\frac{{1}}{{\sqrt{a}}}}$$ \le$xi$ \le$$ \sqrt{{5}}$ ;
b)
x1 + x2 +...+ xm = b * $ \sqrt{{a}}$ for some integers a and b (a > 0).
Determine the maximum value of xp1 + xp2 +...+ xpm for some even positive integer p.
Input 
Each input line contains four integers: m, p, a, b ( m$ \le$2000, p$ \le$12, p is even). Input is correct, i.e. for each input numbers there exists x1, x2,..., xm satisfying the given conditions.
Output 
For each input line print one number - the maximum value of expression, given above. The answer must be rounded to the nearest integer.
Sample Input 
1997 12 3 -318 
10 2 4 -1
Sample Output 
189548 
6


I made 4 mistakes!
1) Nearest integer! Should be (long long)(ans+0.5)!
2) Simplify it! Multiply sqrt(a)! Will turn it into integer!
3) My how_many function is wrong!! I want to do something clever, but wrong!!!
This is a hard-find bug. When m == b, num_negative might be -1!
4) p is an integer!! Use p/2.0 instead of p/2!! (But p is even, p/2 is okay)
